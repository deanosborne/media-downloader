# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring and improving the media-downloader application. The current codebase shows signs of technical debt, code duplication, and architectural inconsistencies that need to be addressed to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Layer Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent service layer architecture, so that I can easily maintain and extend API integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing service classes THEN the system SHALL provide a base service class with common HTTP functionality
2. WHEN creating API service instances THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection for configuration management
3. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling across all services
4. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN services need configuration THEN the system SHALL access configuration through a centralized config manager

### Requirement 2: Configuration Management Centralization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management, so that configuration access is consistent and secure across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing configuration values THEN the system SHALL use a single configuration manager class
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL notify dependent services automatically
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL provide secure configuration storage
4. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL validate required fields on startup
5. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Database Layer Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper database abstraction layer, so that database operations are consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use repository pattern for data access
2. WHEN handling database errors THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling
3. WHEN creating database models THEN the system SHALL use proper data validation
4. WHEN performing transactions THEN the system SHALL support atomic operations
5. WHEN migrating database schema THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities

### Requirement 4: Frontend Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent React component architecture, so that the UI is maintainable and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL separate presentation from business logic
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use proper state management patterns
3. WHEN handling API calls THEN the system SHALL use custom hooks for data fetching
4. WHEN displaying loading states THEN the system SHALL provide consistent loading indicators
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
3. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL use structured logging format
4. WHEN errors are critical THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide request/response tracing capabilities

### Requirement 6: Code Organization and Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized code structure, so that I can navigate and maintain the codebase efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing backend code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into appropriate layers
2. WHEN organizing frontend code THEN the system SHALL group related components and utilities
3. WHEN creating utilities THEN the system SHALL place them in appropriate shared modules
4. WHEN defining constants THEN the system SHALL centralize them in configuration files
5. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL separate it from presentation logic

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast application performance, so that I can efficiently manage my media downloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching strategies
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL debounce user input appropriately
3. WHEN rendering lists THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization for large datasets
4. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking with minimal overhead
5. WHEN updating UI THEN the system SHALL minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 8: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing backend code THEN the system SHALL provide unit test utilities
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide integration test helpers
3. WHEN testing React components THEN the system SHALL provide component testing utilities
4. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide consistent mocking patterns
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear test reporting

### Requirement 9: Security Improvements

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure handling of sensitive data, so that API keys and user data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive configuration data
2. WHEN logging requests THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information
3. WHEN handling file paths THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize user input
4. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication
5. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security headers

### Requirement 10: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent development experience, so that I can be productive when working on the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup documentation
2. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide hot reloading for both frontend and backend
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide source maps and debugging utilities
4. WHEN linting code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent code style
5. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks for quality checks
